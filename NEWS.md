# cgalPolygons 0.1.2

No change. This is just a resubmission of the previous version, which has been 
archived because of an issue regarding RcppCGAL.


# cgalPolygons 0.1.1

The previous version has been archived on CRAN because of a warning due to the 
CGAL library. This version is the same but as RcppCGAL has been updated, I 
expect that this warning has gone.


# cgalPolygons 0.1.0

First release.
